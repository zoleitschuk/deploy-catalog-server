### Instructions

To bring up address informaiton on a particular point click on the marker on the map; or if viewing on a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer you can also click on the name of the location in the sidebar.

The content of the map and the sidebar can be filtered by entering text into the filter text box in the top of the sidebar. In mobile, the map points are filtered by selecting the location name in the dropdown selector underneath the map.

Users can use locations of high concentration to highlight locations in the city that are worthwhile oportunities for exploration.
